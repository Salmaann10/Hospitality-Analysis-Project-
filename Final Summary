Final Summary

This Hospitality Analysis Project for AtliQ Grands provided critical business and data intelligence to help the luxury hotel chain regain its market share and revenue. By leveraging Power BI, SQL, and advanced analytics, I designed a comprehensive dashboard that offered actionable insights into revenue trends, occupancy rates, and customer satisfaction across multiple properties.

Key achievements include the development of new visual elements like a calendar visual for analyzing booking trends, a deep understanding of industry-specific cancellation policies, and the use of Power BI’s bookmarks and selection tools for seamless navigation. The project also identified key areas for operational improvements, such as optimizing occupancy and reducing cancellations, which could drive significant financial gains for AtliQ Grands.

Overall, this project not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into the strategic management of hospitality operations.
